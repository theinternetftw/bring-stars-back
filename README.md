# bring-stars-back

This is a Greasemonkey script which adds DVD star ratings for Netflix titles back to the streaming site (for the titles that appear on the DVD side of the site). This probably requires a DVD enabled Netflix account.

### Features:

* Allows customization of what ratings to show (e.g. show/hide avg stars, predicted stars, new score, and so forth. See the top of the script for controls).
* Niche feature: lets you dump all the ratings loaded so far to the console via Alt-P, which you can then use to compare all the ratings offline (i.e. see how the new rating system matches up to the stars system in aggregate).

### Disclaimers:

Note that Netflix does not have a public API, thus this extension may break at any time.

Also, this is a hack developed just far enough to be comfortable for my personal use. It may mature over time, but it's starting off as just fulfilling a request to share exactly what I'm using, not to provide a polished product.
