# bring-stars-back

This is a greasemonkey script and browser extension which adds DVD star ratings for Netflix titles back to the streaming site
(for the titles that appear on the DVD side of the site).

To get predicted ratings for your profile requires a **DVD enabled Netflix account**, otherwise only an average community star
rating is available. It may also only work in the **US region** at the moment (or regions where you have DVD service as an option).
Adding support for more regions will require help from those regions, if it's possible at all.

[(Experimental) Chrome Extension can be found here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bring-stars-back/eenicmhcjnllfpjhmigeaalannooliai/)

(Firefox extensions take longer to get approved, will appear here later)

### Features:

* Allows customization of what ratings to show (e.g. show/hide avg stars, predicted stars, new score, and so forth). See the top of
  the script for controls, or check the options page if you're using the browser extension version.
* Niche feature: lets you dump all the ratings loaded so far to the console via Alt-P, which you can then use to compare all the
  ratings offline (i.e. see how the new rating system matches up to the stars system in aggregate).

### Disclaimers:

Note that Netflix does not have a public API, thus this extension may break at any time.

Also, this is a hack developed just far enough to be comfortable for my personal use. It may mature over time, but it's starting off
as just fulfilling a request to share exactly what I'm using, not to provide a polished product.
